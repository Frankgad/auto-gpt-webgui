# Auto-GPT WebGUI

Using the work of [Auto-GPT WebUI](https://github.com/choephix/auto-gpt-webui). this project offers a user-friendly web interface to interact with [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT).

It uses Redis instead of Pinecone as a memory Backend, utilizes nginx as a reverse proxy, and only needs Docker to be installed. The application is capable of being launched locally or remotely.

### üåü Special thanks to all the contributors to [the original Auto-GPT project](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT) and to [Auto-GPT WebUI](https://github.com/choephix/auto-gpt-webui) for their hard work and for making this project possible! üåü

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

Clone the repo, then enter the root directory and run the following commands:

```bash
export BACKEND_URL=localhost ## or the FQDN of the remote system
docker compose up -d
```

- This will start the different containers.
- The web interface can be accessed under (http://localhost:7070) or using the FQDN of the remote machine.

Once finished, use the following command to shutdown and cleanup the docker environment.
